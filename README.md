SimpleSim
=========

A simple simulation for an animal/plant environment that I've been wanting to make for a while.  It have several traits that I want to vary slightly from generation to generation, and see what happens given a certain population.  It will also be possible for an animal to effectively "speciate," which will happen when an offspring is too dissimilar from the parents.  I'm mostly just interested in seeing what will happen, and seeing if a stable population will ever develop.  I'm not in the country right now, so who knows how much work will get done on this until I get back though...

So far, the features are:
    -two classes
    -heavy coupling between the interfaces
    -general bad coding practices.
